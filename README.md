This repository demonstrates a subtle issue related to the std::vector<bool> specialization in C++.  The specialization optimizes memory usage for vectors of booleans, but this optimization can lead to unexpected behavior when calculating the size in bytes or directly accessing elements using indexing. The `bug.cpp` file showcases the problem, while `bugSolution.cpp` provides solutions to avoid these issues.
